 we classify the nodes in the graph into two types: critical nodes, and non-critical nodes. 
 
 All steiner nodes of degree greater than 2 and all terminal nodesare classified as critical nodes. 
 
Thus, all non-critical nodes are steiner nodes with degree exactly equal to 2. 

Further, we define a key path to be a path in the steiner tree that has
critical nodes as its end points and each intermediate node is a non-critical node. 

A steiner tree can be considered to be a minimum spanning tree with critical nodes as
vertices and key paths as edges.

* node-based  (remove/insert steiner nodes)
* key-path based
